h2:<Introduction>
I hope you find this website useful. It's really just a bunch of random information about Penguins and an expression of my personal web design touch. Most of the data on this webpage was collected from Penguins-World.

THE MOST KNOWN SPECIES:
Emperor Penguin
Royal Penguin
King Penguin

SPECIES THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE:
Yellow-eyed penguin
Chinstrap Penguin
Fiordland Penguin
Macaroni Penguin

PENGUINS MOTION:
The walking motion when penguins are on the move from one location to another is called waddle. Penguins have short legs and their knees are close to their body. This makes the penguin walk look like a waddle, and hence the name. The next paragraph contains some very important information about penguins. You really should pay attention to the Species and Penguins tab to learn more about these wonderful animals.

Penguins (order Sphenisciformes — family Spheniscidae) are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galapagos penguin, found north of the equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Adult penguins only recognize their own baby chicks. Parents can tell the chicks apart based on a unique call that every chick has, according to SeaWorld.

There are 17 penguin species part of the Spheniscidae family. This family includes non-flying birds with a semi-aquatic lifestyle and anatomical characteristics very different from other types of birds that we commonly know. Different species List include African Penguin, Chinstrap Penguin, Emperor Penguin, Gentoo Penguin, Adelie Penguin, King Penguin, Galapagos Penguin, Humboldt Penguin, Erect-crested Penguin, Macaroni Penguin, Fiordland Penguin, Snares Penguin, Magellanic Penguin, Royal Penguin, Little Blue Penguin, Rockhopper Penguin, Yellow-eyed Penguin.

African Penguin - Spheniscus demersus
The African penguin, also known as Jackass Penguin, is a small banded species with a social behavior that inhabits the warm environments of South Africa and part of the coast of Namibia. African's life expectancy in the wild is between 10-12 years.

Chinstrap Penguin - Pygoscelis antarcticus
A thin line around the face distinguishes the Chinstrap penguin, a species that lives on several islands and has a great ability for the construction of nests during its reproductive season. Chinstrap's life expectancy in the wild is 12 years.

Emperor Penguin - Aptenodytes forsteri
It is the largest penguin in the world, with an incredible capability to dive deep waters. It performs one of the hardest migrations in the animal kingdom to reach its nesting grounds in Antartica which suppose a high resistance to withstand freezing temperatures. Emperor's life expectancy in the wild is 20 years.

Gentoo Penguin - Pygoscelis papua
It is one of the most recognizable penguins because a white stripe around the eyes that goes through the head. There are two subspecies of this penguin which is part of the group of Brush-tailed Penguins and is the largest species of its genus. Gentoo's life expectancy in the wild is between 10-15 years.

Adelie Penguin - Pygoscelis adeliae
The Adelie Penguin is a species with one of the most stable populations of all penguins. Their distinctive eyes rounded by a white circle that contrasts with the completely black head, help to recognize them. It is one of the two species that spend their life in Antartica. Adelie's life expectancy in the wild is 10 years.

King Penguin - Aptenodytes patagonicus
The king penguin is the second largest species and features bright and intense colors in its chest, head and beak. The king penguin has two subspecies distributed around several subantarctic islands, with climates ranging from temperate to cold. King's life expectancy in the wild is 20 years.

Galapagos Penguin - Spheniscus mendiculus
The Galapagos Penguin inhabits the islands with the same name where the climate is mainly hot. It is the penguin that lives north most, very close to the Equator and eventually reaches waters of the northern hemisphere. They have feeding and reproductive habits different than those of their southern relatives. Galapagos' life expectancy in the wild is 9.5 years.

Humboldt Penguin - Spheniscus humboldti
The Humboldt Penguin is native to the Peruvian and Chilean coasts. It is a Banded Penguin with a Vulnerable conservation status due to several threats, mainly overfishing, that make them harder to find food. Humboldt's life expectancy in the wild is between 10-12 years.

Erect-crested Penguin - Eudyptes sclateri
The Erect-crested Penguin are native to the Antipodes and Bounty Islands, a pair of remote places protected from human activity by the government of New Zealand, which make them hard to see. Despite this, it is one of the species most threatened penguin species. Erect-crested's life expectancy in the wild is 10 years.

Macaroni Penguin - Eudyptes chrysolophus
Macaroni Penguins have a prominent orange-yellow plume that attracts attention. It is one of the most migratory, aggressive and territorial, penguins and prefers to feed on fish and squid. Macaroni's life expectancy in the wild is 12 years. 

Fiordland Penguin - Eudyptes pachyrhynchus
The Fiordland penguin is a crested penguin native to West New Zealand which inhabits the Fiordland region of this country. Its limited distribution makes it one of the least known penguins. Two white patches on each side of the beak make it different from other crested penguins. Fiordland life expectancy in the wild is Unknown.

Snares Penguin - Eudyptes robustus
The Snares Penguin exclusively inhabits the Snares Island in New Zealand. It is part of the group of crested penguins, and its appearance is very similar to the Fiordland penguin. It mainly feeds on krill and squid and only around 20% of fish. Snares' life expectancy in the wild is 11 years.

Magellanic Penguin - Spheniscus magellanicus
The Magellanic Penguin belongs to the group of banded penguins which makes it similar to the Humboldt, African, and Galapagos penguins. It inhabits beautiful landscapes in Argentina and Chile, and it is profoundly affected by “El Niño” phenomenon. Magellanic's life expectancy in the wild is 10 years.

Royal Penguin - Eudyptes schlegeli
The Royal Penguin is part of the group of crested penguins, but it has an entirely white face which makes it easy to identify. It inhabits some Australian islands where it feeds on up to 50% krill and the rest of fish and squid. Royal's life expectancy in the wild is 12 years.

Little Blue Penguin - Eudyptula minor
The Little Blue Penguin is the smallest species with a height of 13 inches. Its feathers have a blueish color, and they inhabit several places of Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania and some islands. They are not migratory and mainly nocturnal penguins. Little Blue's life expectancy in the wild is between 6-20 years.

Rockhopper Penguin - Eudyptes
The Rockhopper penguin has red eyes, short beak, and a characteristic plume. It is part of the crested penguins and has two subspecies distributed in a large area which includes South America and several subantarctic islands. Rockhopper's life expectancy in the wild is 10-15 years.

Yellow-eyed Penguin - Megadyptes antipodes
The Yellow-eyed Penguin has golden-yellow spots around its eyes. It inhabits several islands around New Zealand, and It is not a migratory species. It groups in small colonies as this penguin is not as social as the other species. Yellow-eyed's life expectancy in the wild is 9-10 years.
